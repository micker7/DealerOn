Hi there! Here is my code submission for Problem 2: Sales Taxes. 
I created a menu for the user to select their own custom input from the given prompts, and add whichever item and its corresponding price to a "Shopping Cart" from the DealerOn Shop. 
Based off this word problem, my assumption was to have a a flexible amount of quantities for each item that would print in a special way, as well as have specific tax quidelines to follow based off the item and its tax rate.
Thank you for your time and consideration, I really appreciate it!
